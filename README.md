### Overview
Applied capstone to understand how built-environment factors and station upgrades (especially electrification) relate to Bikeshare ridership/performance, to support new station placement and potential relocation of underperforming stations.

### Objectives
- Measure before/after impacts of station electrification (ridership, ops, maintenance)
- Quantify drivers of “successful” station locations (amenities, transit access, land use)
- Create a scoring rubric for candidate new stations (including equity/access considerations)
- Produce datasets/models suitable for future dashboards and reporting

### Methods (planned)
- Station usage change analysis post-electrification
- Spatial feature engineering (parks, libraries, schools, transit, residential + income context)
- Multi-metric evaluation (ridership + access + event-driven demand like SXSW/ACL)
- Fair/ethical predictive modeling for current + proposed stations

### Deliverables
- Final report + recommendations
- Maps/visualizations
- Demand/scenario models
- Dashboard or stakeholder-ready presentation
- End-of-semester presentation

### Timeline
- Feb: scope + datasets
- Early Mar: cleaning/integration
- Mid Mar: EDA + preliminary findings
- Late Mar: modeling + station analysis
- Early Apr: draft report/visuals
- Mid Apr: final report + presentation
